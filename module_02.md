## Special Instructions for Using Form and / or Login

Please register an account, and remember your login information to login in the future. You will be redirected to the login page upon successful account creation.

In order to see the results form, you must submit a query from the dashboard. Upon successful analysis by the OpenAI API (please allow a few seconds), you will be redirected to the results page for that query. You may view past queries from your history page, and can click in to see the results page for each query in your history
